## Getting started with the Fabric samples



## Test network

The [Fabric test network](test-network) in the samples repository provides a Docker Compose based test network with two
Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below.
You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see
the [test network tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html).

The [Kubernetes Test Network](test-network-k8s) sample builds upon the Compose network, constructing a Fabric 
network with peer, orderer, and CA infrastructure nodes running on Kubernetes.  In addition to providing a sample 
Kubernetes guide, the Kube test network can be used as a platform to author and debug _cloud ready_ Fabric Client 
applications on a development or CI workstation.
